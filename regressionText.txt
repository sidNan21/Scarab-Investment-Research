A linear regression helps us identify and predict the price of a stock based on the general growth (or decline of the stock). As such, the  trend the is heavily based on how the stock has been doing. Thus, this is very reliable value to follow if the time frame we're looking at follows a very obvious, and straightforward trend. If you're looking at a volatile security, it wouldn't be wise to follow this.
A random tree regressor operates differently, based less on the general trend, and more on the decisions made from each of our features. Thus, if you're looking at a security which experiences a lot of volatility, it would be far more beneficial to use a random tree.
A stochastic gradient descent is a model that produces a linear regression, but with a stochastic component to it. Rather than finding the perfect fitted line, we find a line that fits "well," since there is always a random factor in our analysis. Thus, the random regressor might actually produce a better a model, because like stock prices, it factors in a bit of randomness.
